# Retirement Planning Program - Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview

The Retirement Planning Monte Carlo Simulation is a Python program designed to help individuals assess their retirement readiness through probabilistic analysis. The program uses the Monte Carlo simulation technique to model various uncertainties and variables that impact retirement planning, such as market returns, inflation rates, contributions, expenses, taxes, and Social Security benefits.

## Features

- Monte Carlo Simulation: The program utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to generate random market scenarios, inflation rates, and sequence of returns risk, providing a realistic distribution of retirement outcomes.

- Dynamic Parameters: The simulation considers dynamic parameters like inflation-adjusted contributions, retirement expenses, and Social Security benefits, reflecting real-world financial planning.

- Tax Considerations: The program incorporates tax implications on investment returns, contributing to a more accurate assessment of retirement savings.

- Personalized Planning: Users can input their retirement savings, expected monthly contributions, estimated retirement expenses, and desired retirement duration. This allows for personalized retirement planning tailored to the individual's financial situation.


## Installation and Usage

1. Ensure you have Python (version 3.x) installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

3. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

4. Run the `retirement_planning.py` script:

   ```bash
   python retirement_planning.py
   ```

5. The program will perform Monte Carlo simulations and provide the probability of your retirement savings lasting throughout your retirement period.

## How to Use

1. Open the Python script "retirement_planning_simulation.py" in a Python-compatible IDE or text editor.

2. Modify the input parameters within the script to match your financial situation:
   - `initial_balance`: Initial retirement savings.
   - `monthly_contribution`: Monthly contributions to the retirement savings.
   - `retirement_expenses`: Expected monthly expenses during retirement.
   - `retirement_duration`: The number of years of retirement.
   - `investment_returns_mean`: Average expected annual investment return.
   - `investment_returns_volatility`: Volatility of investment returns.
   - `inflation_rate_mean`: Average expected annual inflation rate.
   - `inflation_rate_volatility`: Volatility of inflation rate.
   - `lifespan`: Expected age at which you may live.
   - `tax_rate`: Estimated tax rate on investment gains.
   - `social_security_benefit`: Monthly Social Security benefit (if applicable).

3. Save the modified script.

4. Run the Python script to execute the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Example Usage

```python
python retirement_planning.py

Enter the following retirement parameters:
Initial Balance: 500000
Monthly Contribution: 3000
Retirement Expenses: 4000
Retirement Duration (years): 30
Mean Investment Returns: 0.06
Volatility of Investment Returns: 0.12
Mean Inflation Rate: 0.02
Volatility of Inflation Rate: 0.005
Lifespan (years): 85
Tax Rate: 0.15
Monthly Social Security Benefit: 2000

```

## Results

```python
Probability of retirement savings lasting until the end of retirement: 0.82
```
